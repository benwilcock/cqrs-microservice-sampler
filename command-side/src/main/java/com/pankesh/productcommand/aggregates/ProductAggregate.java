/**
 * ProductAggregate is essentially a DDD AggregateRoot (from the DDD concept). In event-sourced
 * systems, Aggregates are often stored and retreived using a 'Repository'. In the
 * simplest terms, Aggregates are the sum of their applied 'Events'.
 * <p/>
 * The Repository stores the aggregate's Events in an 'Event Store'. When an Aggregate
 * is re-loaded by the repository, the Repository re-applies all the stored events
 * to the aggregate thereby re-creating the logical state of the Aggregate.
 * <p/>
 * The ProductAggregate Aggregate can handle and react to 'Commands', and when it reacts
 * to these com.pankesh.product.commands it creates and 'applies' Events that represent the logical changes
 * to be made. These Events are also handled by the ProductAggregate.
 * <p/>
 * Axon takes care of much of this via the CommandBus, EventBus and Repository.
 * <p/>
 * Axon delivers com.pankesh.product.commands placed on the bus to the Aggregate. Axon supports the 'applying' of
 * Events to the Aggregate, and the handling of those events by the aggregate or any other
 * configured EventHandlers.
